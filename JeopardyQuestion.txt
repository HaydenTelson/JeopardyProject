A parameter variable's scope is:
200
the method in which the parameter is declared
the class to which the method belongs
the method in which the parameter is declared
the main method
All of these
A constructor:
200
has the same name as the class
has the same name as the class
has return type of void
always accepts two arguments
always has an access specifier of private
Subscript numbering always starts at what value?
200
0
1
0
-2
none of these
Java automatically stores this value in all uninitialized static member variables:
200
0
null
false
0
-1
This type of method performs a task and sends a value back to the code that called it
400
value-returning
void
complex
value-returning
local
After the header, the body of the method appears inside a set of:
400
braces
brackets
double quotes
braces
parentheses
By default, Java initializes array elements with what value?
400
0
1
100
0
-1
When a field is declared static, there will be:
400
only one copy of the field in memory
a copy of the field for each static method in the class
only one copy of the field in memory
a copy of the field in each class object
only two copies of the field in memory
Local variables can be intialized with
600
any of these
constants
parameter
the results of an arithmetic operation
any of these
One or more objects may be created from a(n):
600
class
instance
method
field
class
In Java, you do not use the new operator when you use a(n):
600
initialization list
array size declarator
initialization list
two-dimensional array
all of these
The whole-part relationship created by object aggregation is more often called:
600
a has a relationship
an extra class relationship
a has a relationship
an inside class relationship
an inner class relationship
Values that are sent into a method are called:
800
arguments
types
literals
variables
arguments
Instance methods do not have this key word in their headers:
800
static
static
private
protected
public
This ArrayList class method deletes an item from an ArrayList.
800
remove
delete
erase
purge
remove
The term for the relationship created by object aggregation is:
800
has a	
Sub-class object
is a
has a
Inner class
